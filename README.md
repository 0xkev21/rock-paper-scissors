# A Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
This is a simple Rock, Paper and Scissors Game. I bet you already know the rules.

The thing is who reach 5 points first will win the game.

Enjoy !

## About the Project
This is a project I created to complete **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors)** assignment.

The page is fully responsive on both 
Desktop & Mobile

This is my own solution. I wrote every line of codes on my own.
